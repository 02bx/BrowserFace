## implementation

this is basically a set of scripts associated with various functions:

users, application actions, subscription, etc

if we can do so, the scripts are implemented using unix commands.

for example, to create a user, we actually create a new unix user.

this is our server monolith model, where our multiple businesses with their myriad and overlapping users

all run on a single giant unix server just like users in the multi-user operating system using different applications.

leveraging the power of the web + the power of unix.

fucking great!
 :p :) xxx

## views

I think I should make the views embeddable in a modal / drop down menu.
